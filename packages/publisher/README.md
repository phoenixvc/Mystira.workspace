## 📚 Architecture

Mystira.Publisher is a frontend-only React SPA that acts as a UI adapter for backend services:

- **No Business Logic Duplication**: All orchestration, workflow management, and validation are handled by backend APIs
- **API-Driven**: Consumes REST and gRPC APIs for all data operations
- **State Reflection**: UI reflects current state exactly as returned by backend services
- **Modern SPA**: Fast, responsive navigation with real-time updates

### Integration Points

- **Admin API**: Project, attribution, user, and audit management
- **Public API**: Story browsing and public attribution lookups
- **Mystira.Chain (gRPC)**: Blockchain registration and immutable audit records
- **StoryGenerator**: Story and project data source

- **Moderator/Editor**: Facilitates consensus and verifies roles
- **Publisher Representative**: Validates institutional participation
- **IP Rights Manager/Legal Counsel**: Ensures compliance and manages disputes
- **Platform Administrator**: Oversees system governance and user management
