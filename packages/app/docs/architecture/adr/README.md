# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Mystira.App project.

---

## What is an ADR?

An **Architecture Decision Record** (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

### Why ADRs?

- 📝 **Document decisions** - Capture the "why" behind architectural choices
- 🕐 **Historical context** - Future developers understand past decisions
- 🤔 **Thoughtful decisions** - Writing forces deliberate thinking
- 🔍 **Transparency** - Team alignment on technical direction
- 📊 **Evaluation** - Track decision outcomes over time

---

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [Who made the decision]
**Tags**: [Relevant tags]

## Context
[What is the issue we're facing?]

## Decision
[What did we decide to do?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or harder as a result?]

## References
[Links to supporting documentation]
```

### Status Values

- **Proposed** 💭 - Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted** ✅ - Decision has been made and is being implemented
- **Deprecated** ⚠️ - Decision is no longer valid but kept for historical context
- **Superseded** 🔄 - Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:

✅ **Affect project structure** - Layering, module boundaries, etc.
✅ **Introduce new patterns** - CQRS, Event Sourcing, etc.
✅ **Change technology stack** - New libraries, frameworks, databases
✅ **Impact team workflow** - Development processes, testing strategies
✅ **Have long-term consequences** - Hard to reverse decisions
✅ **Are controversial** - When team needs alignment

### Don't Create ADRs For:

❌ **Trivial decisions** - Variable naming, code formatting (use linters)
❌ **Temporary workarounds** - Short-term fixes
❌ **Implementation details** - Specific algorithm choices (document in code)
❌ **Operational concerns** - Deployment configs (use runbooks)

---

## How to Create an ADR

### 1. Create a New File

```bash
cd docs/architecture/adr
touch ADR-XXXX-short-title.md
```

**Naming Convention**:
- Use sequential numbering: `ADR-0001`, `ADR-0002`, etc.
- Use kebab-case for title: `adopt-cqrs-pattern`
- Example: `ADR-0003-adopt-event-sourcing.md`

### 2. Fill in the Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Descriptive Title]

**Status**: Proposed
**Date**: 2025-XX-XX
**Deciders**: [Your Name, Team Name]
**Tags**: [Relevant tags]

## Context

Describe the current situation and the problem you're trying to solve.

### Problems with Current Approach

- Problem 1
- Problem 2

### Considered Alternatives

1. **Alternative 1**
   - ✅ Pro 1
   - ❌ Con 1

2. **Alternative 2** ⭐ CHOSEN
   - ✅ Pro 1
   - ✅ Pro 2

## Decision

Explain what you decided to do and why.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences ✅

1. Benefit 1
2. Benefit 2

### Negative Consequences ❌

1. Drawback 1 (and mitigation strategy)
2. Drawback 2 (and mitigation strategy)

## References

- Link 1
- Link 2
```

### 3. Review with Team

- Share the ADR in a pull request
- Gather feedback from team members
- Update based on discussion
- Merge when consensus is reached

### 4. Update the Index

Add your ADR to the table in this README.

## Best Practices

### Writing ADRs

✅ **Be concise** - Focus on the decision, not implementation details
✅ **Explain trade-offs** - Include both pros and cons
✅ **Document alternatives** - Show what you considered
✅ **Include context** - Help future readers understand the situation
✅ **Link to resources** - Reference articles, docs, related ADRs
✅ **Update status** - Keep ADRs current (Deprecated, Superseded)

### Reviewing ADRs

✅ **Check completeness** - Is the context clear? Are consequences listed?
✅ **Validate alternatives** - Were reasonable options considered?
✅ **Assess reversibility** - How hard is it to undo this decision?
✅ **Consider timing** - Is now the right time for this decision?
✅ **Align with vision** - Does this support project goals?

## ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → [Implemented] → [Evaluated]
                    ↓
                  Deprecated (if no longer valid)
                    ↓
                  Superseded (if replaced by newer ADR)
```

### Evaluation

After 3-6 months of implementation:
- Review the decision's impact
- Update the ADR with lessons learned
- Consider whether to continue, modify, or deprecate
