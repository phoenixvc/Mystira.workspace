## Migration Principles

1. **Zero Downtime**: All migrations maintain service availability
2. **Rollback Strategy**: Every migration has a documented rollback plan
3. **Incremental Approach**: Large migrations are broken into smaller phases
4. **Verification**: Each phase includes validation steps
5. **Documentation**: Migration steps are documented before execution

## Migration Lifecycle

```
Proposal → Analysis → Planning → Execution → Verification → Cleanup
```

### Proposal
- Identify the need for migration
- Document current state and desired state
- Get stakeholder buy-in

### Analysis
- Assess impact and dependencies
- Identify risks and mitigations
- Estimate effort and timeline

### Planning
- Create detailed migration plan
- Define success criteria
- Prepare rollback procedures

### Execution
- Execute migration steps
- Monitor for issues
- Document deviations

### Verification
- Validate success criteria
- Run smoke tests
- Get stakeholder sign-off

### Cleanup
- Remove deprecated code/resources
- Archive documentation
- Update references
